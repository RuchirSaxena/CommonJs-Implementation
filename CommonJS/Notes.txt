CommonJS and its specifications

Common Js
common js is all about how 2 programmers who are 
working on different modules can interact with eachother
javascript till ES5 lacks modular development ,so the 
developers at that time was using commom js , so common js
developer will create exports variable and will give out
all things he wants to expose and the person who consume
will use the require keyword to get the object
so we can say that common js is the specification in which
we use the require and export keyword to define dependencies
between 2 modules.

Common JS Specification ->

				Module A
				    |
					|
				 Require
				    |
					|
				 Exports
				    |
					|
				 Module B	

CommonJs is a specification to implement we need to use module loaders like 
SystemJS,RequireJS ,Browserify ,Webpack ,curl ,LABjs ,almond)

System Js ->It is a dynamic module loader
when we create a project we divide it in differnt components/modules
for eg: Customer , Supplier
so we will have

customer.js
supplier.js

Generally what we do is we load our component using
script tag in our HTML file one by one
